# Project Name: Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using Support Vector machine learning algorithms. Sentiment analysis aims to determine the emotional tone behind a body of text. By analyzing textual data, we aim to classify the sentiments expressed, such as positive, negative. This can be useful for understanding customer opinions, feedback, and reviews in various domains.
